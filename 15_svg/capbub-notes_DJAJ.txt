//K#15 -- Capture Bubble Toil Trouble
//2020-04-02

Sample 1
Expected:
- When clicking on a table cell, an alert should pop up with the character names
Reality:
- Works as expected

Sample 2
Expected:
- Shows inner HTML in following order: table, tr, td
Reality:
- Actual order of alerts: td, tr, table

Sample 3
Expected:
- Because the useCapture parameter is set to true, we think that the alert will show up in the following order: table, tr, td
- When we uncomment e.stopPropagation(), it will stop the propagation from table down to td, and only the table alert will pop up
Reality:
- Actual order of alerts: table, td, tr (SURPRISE: why was this the case?)
  - perhaps because both td and tr are still on bubble mode, they will run in their set order, even though table is on capture mode
- e.stopPropagation() works as expected

Sample 4
Expected:
- because the useCapture parameter has been set to true for all of them, we think that the alert will show up in this order: table, tr, td
- the order in which the event listeners are added should not matter
- if e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, only the table alert should pop up
Reality:
- order of alerts is as expected
- the order in which event listeners are added do not matter
- e.stopPropagation() works as expected
