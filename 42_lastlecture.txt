Words of Wisdom: 

Brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things
When you do the right thing, good stuff has a way of happening
Every problem that might happen will happen
Get a feedback loop and listen to it
You might have to wait a long time, but people will show you their good side
Head fake - tricking someone into learning something important by making them think they’re learning something else
Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted
When you’re screwing up, and nobody’s saying anything to you anymore, that means they gave up
Be earnest
Tell the truth
Apologize when you screw up
Focus on other people
